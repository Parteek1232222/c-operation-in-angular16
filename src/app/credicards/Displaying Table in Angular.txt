Displaying Table in Angular
1.create the model folder and make the interface here with the help of cli
2.import in the component.ts file and the declare  inn the array with the same parameters
and we initialize in the interface 
3.table data of that data type
 ->usually will come from api
 from backwars we are deal with static data till.....
 4.make of the service for (in the form of function)
  5. now we connected the dynamically data to it (commented the static data from vom.ts file)



  .now we are making template driven form in add component (part of ng form)
  ----------->it is done for add new user 
                                        ->set the ui
                                        ->implement in the component 
                                        ->call the service
